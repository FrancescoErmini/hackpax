I will catch customer feedback on the product on the dedicated website [Blog](http://hackpax.com/).

The aim of this repository is:
* Give visibility to the project to involve developers that actually works in cyber security.
* Gather opinions on the project and evaluate if it is worth spending time to build this device.
* Involve similar projects hosted on github
* use a mailing list to discuss about technical requirements

Hardware required for the first MVP is:
* Raspberry Pi 3
* TFT 3.5'
* USB to Ethernet adapter

Even if this hardware is not optimal it's suitable for a prototype.
